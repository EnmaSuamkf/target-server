/**
 * The geometry behind the workflow canvas — where every card, judge circle and
 * arrow goes, and what state each of them is in.
 *
 * The step list answers "what is in this workflow" one row at a time; it does
 * not answer "what runs after what, and what has to pass before it does". A
 * workflow IS a graph — steps in sequence, a judge hanging off the ones with
 * acceptance criteria, a retry loop back into the step the judge rejected — and
 * a stack of cards can only imply that with its ordering. The canvas draws it.
 *
 * The canvas is a READ of the workflow, never an edit of it: nothing here
 * produces a mutation, and every node carries the id of the step it stands for
 * so a click can send the operator to that step's row, which is where editing
 * lives. That split is deliberate — one place to change a workflow, one place
 * to see its shape.
 *
 * Layout is a vertical spine with side branches:
 *
 *                  ┌──────────────┐
 *                  │  ctx         │        the conversation context, when there is one
 *                  └──────┬───────┘
 *     ┌────────┐   ┌──────▼───────┐        ╭───────╮
 *     │subagent│──▶│  1  step     │───────▶│ judge │   ─┐  a step with acceptance criteria
 *     └────────┘   └──────┬───────┘        ╰───────╯    │  is judged before the run moves on
 *                         │  ◀─────────────────────────┘   (dashed = the retry it can force)
 *                  ┌──────▼───────┐
 *                  │  2  step     │        no box on the left: this one runs inline
 *                  └──────────────┘
 *
 * The two side branches are the two questions the list answers in words and the
 * canvas answers in shape: WHO does the work (the box on the left — a subagent,
 * or nobody, meaning the session does it itself) and WHAT has to pass before the
 * run moves on (the circle on the right).
 *
 * Vertical, not horizontal, for two reasons: it is the order the steps already
 * read in, and it is the axis a phone has room on — a horizontal chain of six
 * cards is a scroll bar, a vertical one is a page.
 *
 * Edges are routed here rather than in the component so the whole picture is one
 * pure function over plain data: the SVG only has to draw the points it is
 * handed, and the hub's node:test suite can assert the shape without a DOM (see
 * hub/canvas-view.test.ts).
